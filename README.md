# fpl_points_predictor

Using machine learning to create a point predictor for fantasy premier league.

Grouped datasets into positions( GK, DEF, MID, FWD ) and used a random forest model to predict a players points for an upcoming gameweek.  Features considered vary by position but some included are total goals, assists, clean sheets, expected stats, and bonus points system.

I used data from the 2023/2024 season as my test dataset, and the three previous seasons as my training dataset.
