# fpl_points_predictor
Using machine learning to create a point predictor for [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/). 

## Model Details
### Datasets
- **Training Data:** 20/21, 21/22, 22/23 season data
- **Testing Data:** 23/24 season data

Data from https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League.
- **Preprocessing:** data from each player is averaged across prior gameweeks and then used as features for the model.
  - Features vary by position and include metrics such as goals scored, assists, clean sheets, expected points/goals/assists/clean sheets/goals conceded, ict_index, BPS(bonus points system), and more
    
### Random Forest Model 
- From scikit learn, outperformed linear regression and neural network models when tested on historical data.
- A separate model was created for each position(Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Forward), which significantly improved accuracy compared to using a single model for all positions.
- Provides insight into which metrics matter most for each position.

## Additional Features
- **Automated Team Management:** Recommends an initial team and proposes transfers based on predicted points from the model.  It also takes into account actual points scored from prior weeks and upcoming fixture difficulty.

## Future Improvements
Future work will focus on improving transfer recommendations by considering additional factors.  I also plan to develop an interactive web application to provide users with customized team suggestions.

## Example
Recommendations for a given gameweek:
